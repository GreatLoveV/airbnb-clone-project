# üè° StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project Blueprint

## üìò Project Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It emphasizes backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project allows learners to build a scalable web application while understanding complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics.

### üéØ Project Goals

- Develop backend systems using industry-standard tools and frameworks.
- Design secure, scalable RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
- Create and manage a relational database schema suitable for a real-world app.
- Understand and implement CI/CD pipelines.
- Practice collaborative development workflows using GitHub.

## üë• Team Roles

Here are the key roles involved in the project and their responsibilities:

- **Backend Developer**  
  Builds and maintains the server-side logic, API endpoints, and application architecture. Ensures proper data flow between client and server and handles business logic.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Designs, implements, and manages the database schema. Responsible for data integrity, performance tuning, and backup strategies.

- **DevOps Engineer**  
  Implements CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker. Ensures smooth deployment and monitors application environments.

- **Project Manager**  
  Coordinates tasks, sets deadlines, and ensures smooth communication among team members. Oversees progress and quality assurance.

- **QA Tester**  
  Tests the application for bugs, functionality, performance, and security issues. Helps ensure a reliable and user-friendly platform.

- **Security Specialist**  
  Focuses on implementing security measures to protect the application and user data. Monitors authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

## üß∞ Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone project uses a modern and scalable technology stack:

- **Django**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build the core backend logic and RESTful APIs efficiently with built-in support for user authentication, admin interfaces, and ORM.

- **MySQL**  
  A reliable and powerful relational database used to store structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and reviews.

- **GraphQL**  
  A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST.

- **Docker**  
  A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated environments for consistent development, testing, and deployment.

- **GitHub**  
  A web-based version control platform used for source code management and team collaboration through issues, pull requests, and branching strategies.

- **GitHub Actions**  
  A CI/CD automation tool that helps run tests, perform builds, and deploy the application automatically whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.

  ## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The database structure is designed to reflect the core components of an Airbnb-like booking platform. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

### **1. Users**
Represents the individuals who interact with the platform (hosts or guests).
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `username`: User's login name
- `email`: Contact information
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `role`: Host or guest

**Relationship**: A user can create multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

---

### **2. Properties**
Represents listings available for booking.
- `id`: Unique property identifier
- `owner_id`: Foreign key to the user who owns the property
- `title`: Name of the property
- `location`: Geographic location
- `price_per_night`: Cost for one night

**Relationship**: Each property is owned by one user and can have many bookings and reviews.

---

### **3. Bookings**
Tracks reservations made by guests.
- `id`: Unique booking ID
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the guest who made the booking
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property
- `check_in_date`: Start date of the booking
- `check_out_date`: End date of the booking

**Relationship**: A booking belongs to one user and one property.

---

### **4. Reviews**
Contains feedback left by guests after a stay.
- `id`: Unique review ID
- `user_id`: Reviewer‚Äôs ID (guest)
- `property_id`: Reviewed property ID
- `rating`: Numeric rating (e.g., 1‚Äì5)
- `comment`: Text feedback

**Relationship**: A user can leave multiple reviews, and a property can have many reviews.

---

### **5. Payments**
Represents financial transactions related to bookings.
- `id`: Unique payment ID
- `booking_id`: Associated booking
- `amount`: Payment amount
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status`: e.g., completed, pending, failed

**Relationship**: A payment is linked to one booking.
